# Social Activity Based Travel Demand Model
Developed by Rempu Rayat - Graduate Student  # Institute Technology of Bandung (ITB) - School of Architecture, Planning and Policy Development - Transportation Studies
This repository contains data, models and simulation related to travel demand forcasting methods, [![built with Python3.7](https://www.python.org/)
This is just the beginning of research, using Big Data approach instead of traditional data collection.
