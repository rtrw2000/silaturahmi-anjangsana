Dataset:We openly release the dataset, so that other researchers can benefit from it for further improvements and research reproducibility.<br>Dataset in this model is built from people of different gender, age and occupation residing in studying area.
Moreover, we do not impose any restriction on the use of the application, hence every user records the data performing the action as she/he is used to, in order to assess real world conditions.<br>
In this page in addition to downloadable datasets, you can find Python's code for extracting features,and building machine learning models to make predictions.<br>
